Architecture 2: Refers to grid_search on Bily Kriz data. Resulting selected architecture will be used to fit basemodel MLP0. MLP 7/8.
Architecture 3: Refers to grid_search on Bily Kriz data. Resulting selected architecture contains an adaptive pooling layer and will be used to fit MLP0. MLP7/8.
Architecture 4: Refers to grid_search on Bily Kriz, Collelongo, Soro data. 
		Architecture is temporary and will be used to select training epochs and amount of data for fitting MLP 7/8.
Architecture 5: Refers to grid_search on Simulations (5000 samples = 10% of Simulations). 
		Selected Architecture will be used to fit MLP 7/8 in comparision to Architecture 2.
