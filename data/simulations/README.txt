normal_params: 5000 samples of varying climate and varying parameters. Parameters sampled in LHS design from truncated normal distribution.
uniform_params: 5000 samples of varying climate and varying parameters. Parameters sampled in LHS design from uniform distribution.
only_params: 5000 samples of fixed climate and varying parameters. Parameters sampled in LHS design from uniform distribution.
only_climate: 5000 samples with fixed parameters and varying climate.
