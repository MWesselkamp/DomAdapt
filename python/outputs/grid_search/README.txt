The different model numerations refer to the data that they have been trained and evaluated on.

1) 6-fold CV. Training data: 5 Years of Profound data (Le Bray). Validation data: 1 Year of Profound data.
2) 5-fold CV. Training data: 4 Years of Profound data (Le Bray). Validation data: 1 Year of Profound data. Evaluated on Test data: 1 Year of Profound data.
3) 5-fold CV. Training data: 4 Years of Profound data (Le Bray). Validation data: 1 Year of Profound data. 
	Evaluation on Test data: 1 Year of Profound as input features and respective Preles simulations as target.
4) 15-fold CV: Training data: 5 Year of Profound from 3 stands, i.e. 15 years. Validation data: 1 Year of Profound of Profound data.
	Test data: 1 Year of Profound data from 3 different stands, i.e. 3 years.
